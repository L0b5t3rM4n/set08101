		<p class="text" style="font-size: 20px;">
			Starbound is an open world sandbox game where you find yourself fleeing earth in a spaceship after a mysterious tentacle beast destroys it.
			As your spaceship crash-lands on a habitable Garden planet, an adventure begins that will take you hurtling across the universe.<br><br>

			Each time I beamed down from my personal starship into the 2D, 8-bit styled world, I found an experience that shoots for the stars and lands squarely among them. 
			Exploration of a diverse array of planets, biomes, and subterranean nightmares is the highlight of the voyage, but the combat, bosses, and a rich backstory make it absolutely immersive.<br><br>
		
			Take a look!<br><br>
