			Kingdom Hearts is a role-playing video game series about a boy named Sora who is sent on a quest to save the Seven Princesses of Heart 
			after his world is destroyed by dark creatures called "Heartless." 
			An evil being named Ansem wants to use the princesses' hearts of pure light to open the Door to Darkness and gain the power to reign over all worlds. 
			Also, those seven princesses are all Disney princesses, and Sora is accompanied by Donald and Goofy on his world-hopping mission. 
			And he fights Cloud from Final Fantasy 7 at one point.<br><br>

			Envisioned as a crossover game between Disney Interactive and Square Enix, the first Kingdom Hearts game, released in 2002, 
			followed main character Sora as he traveled through different worlds that each represented a different Disney (and later Pixar) property 
			â€” there was Wonderland from Alice in Wonderland, Agrabah from Aladdin, the Olympus Coliseum from Hercules, and so on. 
			Along the way, Sora saved the worlds from collapsing into the darkness brought on by the invasion of Heartless creatures, 
			a mission granted to him by the Final Fantasy characters whose own world had been destroyed.<br><br>

			It looks a bit funky but it's an absoute timeless classic<br><br>

			Take a look!<br><br>
