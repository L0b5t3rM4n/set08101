			</br>Ingredients:
			</br>1 kabocha (Japanese pumpkin)
			</br>1 sweet potato
			</br>1 tbsp olive oil
			</br>½ onion
			</br>4 cloves garlic
			</br>½ tbsp thyme
			</br>½ tsp garam masala
			</br>½ tsp cayenne
			</br>pinch of cinnamon
			</br>salt
			</br>pepper
			</br>1 can of coconut milk</br>

			</br>Dashi Stock
			</br>3 cups water
			</br>2 tbsp bonito flakes
			</br>1 piece of kombu</br>
			
			</br>Preparation steps:
			</br>-Preheat oven to 400°F. Cut the kabocha and sweet potato into large cubes. 
				In a bowl, mix the kabocha, sweet potato and olive oil. 
				Place on a oiled baking sheet and bake until tender, about 35-40 minutes.

			</br>-While the kabocha and sweet potato roast, prepare the dashi stock. 
				Place the water, bonito flakes and kombu in a pot. Bring to a boil, reduce the heat and allow it to simmer for at least 15 minutes. 
				The longer you let the stock cook, the stronger the dashi will be. When the broth is ready, place a mesh strainer over a bowl and strain the broth. 
				Set aside.

			</br>-After the kabocha and sweet potato have finished roasting and the stock has been prepared, it is time to put everything together. 
				Place a deep pot over medium-high heat. Add the onion and garlic. Cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. 
				Add the thyme, garam masala, cayenne, cinnamon, salt and pepper.

			</br>-Add the kabocha and sweet potato and mix well. Pour in the dashi stock. Using an immersion blender, blend until smooth. Add the coconut milk and mix.

			</br>-This next step is the most important and probably most free formed part of this recipe. Taste the soup. 
				If you feel like it is missing something, I would recommend adding a bit more garam masala, cayenne, salt or pepper. 
				Add a small amount of each until you are happy with the result.

			</br>-Pour some soup into a bowl and top with goat cheese. This soup goes extremely well with sourdough bread.
